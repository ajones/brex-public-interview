# Brex Eng Debugging Interview Sample
This "Hello World" program is provided for upcoming Brex candidates to verify their local development setup works before their debugging interview.

## Languages
We currently support 3 programming languages (Java, Python & Javascript) for this interview. You should pick the language you are most comfortable with. For each language folder, you'll find a README.md with setup instructions on how to install the necessary programs to run the code. You will be allowed to lookup online documentation for help on language syntax during the interview.

## The "Hello World" program
The "Hello World" program reads a file and returns it to caller. The program will has 2 unit tests (1 passing, 1 failing). You should check that both unit tests run and that you're able to fix the 2nd unit test.

## Preparing for your interview
On the day of your interview, your interviewer will be sending you a zip file that contains the code for the buggy program. You'll be using your own computer to run the program and fix it. You may use any text editor or IDE to assist in solving the bugs. You can add print statements or change the code to help with finding the bug.

You can also use a debugger as well to set breakpoints to further debug the program. However, it is not recommended to use a debugger if you're new to it. The program can be solved with just using print statements.

## Questions
If you have any other questions about this interview, feel free to reach out to your recruiter.
